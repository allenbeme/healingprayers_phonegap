                    <h2>Healing Words</h2>
                    <p>Physical health is the will of God. Emotional and and mental
                        health is the will of God. Prosperity is the will of God.
                        Knowing this, we must focus on believing that God always
                        honors His Word and answers petitions which are made according
                        to His will. And His will is not hidden from His children:
                        we have the scripture and we have the Holy Spirit.</p>

                    <p>One way to deepen our faith in God is to speak the Word of
                        God. Recount His promises. Review the scriptures which
                        testify to His goodness and grace towards His children.
                        Internalize the Word of God. Personalize it. Make it God's
                        specific revelation to you.</p>
